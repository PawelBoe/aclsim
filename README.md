A small C-program for simulating cisco ACL filtering functions by applying rules to a fixed test-vector file.

This is still in progress and therefore not yet safe to use. A first working prototype is usable, but beware that it contains bugs. It WILL produce SEGFAULTS if you don´t stick to the correct rule and vector syntax. This is due to the fact that there is still some error handling missing.

I´m just learning C, meaning that at this stage the program probably contains some bad programming, consider yourself warned..
