A small C-program for simulating cisco ACL filtering functions by applying rules to a fixed test-vector file.

This is still in progress and therefore not yet safe to use. For a first working prototype, an implementation of the "parse_rule" function needs to be made. So if you are interested, please be patient :)

I´m just learning C, meaning that at this stage the program probably contains many bugs and bad programming style, consider yourself warned..
