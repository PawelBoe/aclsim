# aclsim
A small C-program for simulating cisco ACL filtering functions by applying rules to a fixed test-vector file.

This is a work in progress and it is not yet save to use. For a first working prototype, an implementation of 
the "parse_rule" function needs to be made. So if you are interested, please be patient :)

I´m just learning C, meaning that at this stage the program probably contains many bugs and bad programming style,
don´t be angry, I warned you!
