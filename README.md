A small C-program for simulating cisco ACL filtering functions by applying rules to a fixed test-vector file.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is still in progress and therefore not yet safe to use. For a first working prototype, an implementation of 
the "parse_rule" function needs to be made. So if you are interested, please be patient :)

I´m just learning C, meaning that at this stage the program probably contains many bugs and bad programming style, 
consider yourself warned..

This is still in progress and therefore not yet safe to use. A first working prototype is usable, but beware that it contains bugs. It WILL produce SEGFAULTS if you don´t stick to the correct rule and vector syntax. This is due to the fact that there is still some error handling missing.
